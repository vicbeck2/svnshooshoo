All flags share a common 1:2 proportion, with an additionnal gray 1-pixel
raising border, and are all defined as 34x18 256-colors GIF images.

They were designed to be displayed in a formated list, or as small icons
for web sites, but they do not necessarily respect the proportions of
official flags, because of this designed fixed format.

Those images are copyrighted by the author Philippe Verdy, but they can
freely be reused with no fees.
